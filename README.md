# PriorityQueue-with-Underlying-Binary-Heap-Implementation
3 Parts 

Part 1:
- Created a Minimum Priority Queue

Part 2:
- Created Program that reads JSON file as input with heap operations (insert and removeMin)
- Program executes the heap operations (using part 1) from the JSON file
- Prints the priority queue as a JSON object

Part 3:
- Created a Program which uses a min priority queue to create volleyball teams based on win precentage.
- The Program takes in a JSON file with the number of players, all their combinations and their respective win precentage. 
    - The Program splits 2n (based on input size) players into teams of 2 so everyone has a win precentage closest to 50% and prints the new teams to a JSON object.
